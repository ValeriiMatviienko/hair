    "faq_title": "FAQ",
    "faq_subtitle": "Answers to your questions",
    "faq_question_1": "When should you visit a trichologist?",
    "faq_answer_1": "If you notice increased hair shedding, scalp itching, flaking, dryness, or excess oil. Also if your hair grows slowly, becomes thinner or more fragile — or if you simply want to choose the right care for your scalp and hair. A yearly check-up is also recommended, even without visible symptoms.",
    "faq_question_2": "How long does the consultation take?",
    "faq_answer_2": "From 30 to 75 minutes, depending on the chosen option.",
    "faq_question_3": "What happens during the consultation?",
    "faq_answer_3": "I review all lifestyle factors that may affect scalp and hair health — from stress and diet to sleep and care products. Then I perform a detailed trichoscopy to examine your scalp under magnification.",
    "faq_question_4": "What do you receive after the consultation?",
    "faq_answer_4": "Within 24 hours, you’ll receive a clear action plan with photos, product recommendations, lab test suggestions (if needed), supplements, and care tips — all tailored to you.",
    "faq_question_5": "Can a trichologist help with dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis?",
    "faq_answer_5": "Yes — this is one of the most common concerns. I offer personalized protocols to reduce symptoms and restore scalp balance, often with noticeable results in just a few days.",
    "faq_question_6": "Do I need to do any lab tests beforehand?",
    "faq_answer_6": "No — I’ll let you know after the consultation which tests (if any) are relevant to your case.",
    "faq_question_7": "How should I prepare for the visit?",
    "faq_answer_7": "Avoid washing your hair for at least 12 hours — it helps me assess the scalp in its natural state.",
